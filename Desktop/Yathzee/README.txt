This project let us try to create a game in a new language that we don't know before last week. Indeed, we had to
find some solutions to understand how we can do this together. So the solution of this was to always make the code
together. If someone was lost on an idea, the other one was explaining how doing that. 
find some solutions to understand how we can do this together. 
And the other difficult, was to work together because we never had work together before, so we didn't know how
to work together.At the beginning, we were a little bit scared about this project, because of the game that we didn't know. 
This project allows us to learn another game, and to learn a little about Java, a language that we will use a lot in
our professional career.

For the first part of the java project we encountered some difficulties. 
The game is more complicated than we thought and before we started we had to do a lot of research. 
the positive part was the collaboration between us, we found an efficient working technique which we have eluded to get started 
quickly in carrying out the functions. 
This first part of the project was very positive because we learned more about java and also how to work in pairs.
